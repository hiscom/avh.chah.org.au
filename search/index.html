and nine new zealand herbaria herbarium specimen data is catalogued in accordance with the data entry standards and protocols of each herbarium once aggregated in the ala biocache the data is standardised and a range of quality checks are applied to enhance data retrieval and analysis the standardisation and data processing applied in the biocache is described below the unprocessed data provided by the herbaria is always available an overview of the provided versus processed data is available for each record via the record detail page the avh contains records of the holdings of australian and new zealand herbaria including specimens collected outside those countries it also contains records of cultivated plants and introduced occurrences and while we have the establishment means field to indicate whether a plant is cultivated or not native this has not always been used avh records may also just be wrong a record in the avh of a species from a certain location only means that there is a specimen with this species name from the given location not necessarily that the species with that name naturally occurs at that location the major asset of the avh is that all records are based on preserved specimens so they can to a large extent be verified it is up to the user to decide whether or not verification is warranted by itself the avh data is not more reliable than data

detail page you can use the ala record id to find the most up to date data for the specimen record by typing record id in the navigation bar of your browser basis of recordbasis of record describes the source of the information in a record occurrence records are generally either based on an object such as a preserved specimen or on an observation of an organism in the field object based records are more verifiable than observation based records because the specimens are held in permanent collections and can be examined at a later date and the identification can be verified all avh records are based on objects note that there are currently about 15 000 records from canb and perth which are displayed with the record type human observation however this is a data delivery error all records in the avh are specimen based preparationsthe preparation type of the specimen sheet packet etc date last updatedthe date the record was last updated on the record detail pages this is shown as date loaded and will appear under the location map the date last processed indicates when the record was last processed within the ala biocache this may happen for instance when there is a change in the backbone taxonomy or the sensitive data service or when new environmental layers are loaded collecting eventcollectorthe name of the collector as provided with the specimen record collecting numberthe number or other identifier assigned to the specimen by the collector additional collectorsthe names of any additional collectors who were present at the time the specimen was collected collecting datethe date that the specimen was collected collecting dates in the avh are delivered in two ways as collecting date which has to be iso compliant or as verbatim collecting date some herbaria deliver verbatim collecting date only when an iso compliant collecting date can t be delivered or not all information can be delivered as an iso compliant date e g summer of 69 while others deliver it for all collecting dates because of database restrictions some herbaria are only able to deliver incomplete collecting dates as verbatim collecting date we hope to remedy this in the near future a small proportion of records in the avh are undated these will predominantly be historical pre 1900 records but will also include records collected in the twentieth century querying by datethe collecting date term in the advanced search form allows you to query for a range of collecting dates if you enter just a start date or an end date your results will include records of specimens collected since or up to that date respectively to query for a particular collecting date enter the same date in both fields because of problems associated with querying incomplete dates the results for a search that includes a collecting date term will only return records with complete collecting dates date facetsthere are year month and decade facets on the results page that allow you to filter your results for records collected in a particular year month or decade note that the decade facet and chart only include records with complete collecting dates records with only a month and a year or just a year will not be counted localitythe locality at which the specimen was collected habitata description of the habitat that the plant alga or fungus was growing in provided by the collector s of the specimen some herbarium databases have this information split into multiple fields e g habitat associated taxa substrate and host but the information from the separate fields is concatenated before being delivered to the avh collecting notesany additional notes about the specimen or the collecting event provided by the collector some herbaria store this information in multiple fields in their herbarium databases for example collecting notes and descriptive notes but this information is concatenated for delivery to the avh some herbarium databases have a general notes field and no other place to store notes from determiners or data entry personnel and even those that do have dedicated fields for other types of notes have not always had them so for many records collecting notes will contain more than just collecting notes phenologythe phenology field indicates whether the specimen is bearing flowers or fruits etc establishment meansestablishment means describes how the specimen was established at the collecting locality it combines the hispid concepts cultivation status and natural occurrence cultivation status can be one of the following values cultivated not cultivated assumed to be cultivated and doubtfully cultivated cultivation status is not recorded consistently among the different herbaria and is not provided by all herbaria natural occurrence indicates whether the occurrence is natural or whether the specimen has been introduced at the collecting locality allowed values are native assumed to be native doubtfully native and not native this information is recorded rather haphazardly conservation statusthe conservation status associated with the taxon in the state or territory in which it was collected the classification codes for each state or territory are listed in table 2 table 2 conservation status classification codes for australian states and territories state classification codes western australia presumed extinct critically endangered endangered vulnerable priority one poorly known taxa with few populations on threatened lands priority two poorly known taxa with few populations including some on conservation lands priority three poorly known taxa with several or widespread populations priority four rare but not threatened taxa in need of monitoring priority five conservation dependent taxa that are dependent on

queensland extinct in the wild endangered vulnerable near threatened least concern new south wales presumed extinct critically endangered endangered vulnerable endangered population australian capital territory endangered vulnerable victoria presumed extinct endangered vulnerable rare poorly known tasmania extinct endangered vulnerable rare taxonomytaxon names in the avhthe ala applies taxon name resolution to incoming data the taxon name with a record will be stored in the ala biocache exactly as it is delivered to the avh called taxon name provided in the avh but the taxon name will also be processed the processing of the taxon name includes parsing the name into its parts e g genus name and epithet s if the name can be parsed the name resolver will try to match the canonical name against the ala name list if no match can be found or the name could not be parsed it will try to match the genus name if the genus name is not in the ala name list it will try to match the name of the family which is provided separately if a matched name is in one of the authoritative national checklists that are part of the ala name list such as the australian plant census apc and if the matched name is considered a synonym the processed name will be the accepted name from the checklist the processed taxon name is called taxon name processed in the avh the identified to rank is the rank of the processed taxon name this may be the same rank as the rank of the provided name or a higher rank if the rank of the processed name is different from that of the provided name and the name resolver can work out the rank of the provided name the rank of the provided name will be given on the record detail page as well the name match metric describes how the provided name was matched to a name in the ala name list if the parsed name was matched the name match metric will be canonical name match higher taxa match means that the name itself could not be matched but the name of a higher taxon genus or family could no match means that neither the provided name nor the name of a higher taxon could be matched to a name in the ala name list author is the authorship of the processed name the authorship of the provided name is given as part of taxon name provided the common name processed is the common name recorded in the ala name list common names are never provided by the herbaria classificationthere are facets for taxonomic groups of all mandatory ranks kingdom phylum class order family genus species and for infraspecific taxon these taxonomic groups are also given on the record detail page and in the downloads if there was no match for a provided name the names of the taxonomic groups provided with the specimen record will be displayed botanical groupthe botanical group facet allows you to select records of a botanical group that is not necessarily a taxonomic group for example bryophytes angiosperms or dicotyledons some other useful groupings e g lichens have not been implemented yet but will be added when the national species lists have been completed as these are not taxonomic groups botanical groups may overlap and not all taxa are represented in one of the recognised groups identification qualifierthe identification qualifier facet can be used to select records with certain determination qualifiers or to exclude records with uncertain determination note that excluding records with uncertain determination disqualifies all records with determination qualifiers no matter at what rank the qualifier applies if a qualifier applies at the infraspecific rank you might want to include the determination in the results of a taxon name query in this case you are better off keeping the uncertain determinations and deleting the ones that you don t want from the output or do a filter on uncertain determinations and see what you are going to throw out addendumthe taxon name addendum is a qualifier that comes after the taxon name name addenda endorsed by hispid translated in proper english are s str in the narrow sense s l in the broad sense and agg aggregate group complex the first two are supposed to be used to differentiate between competing taxon concepts but s l is often used to indicate uncertainty about whether the specimen belongs to the taxon in question or if it belongs to a similar taxon in this case agg would have been more appropriate to use often aggregates are not formally recognised although there is mostly general agreement on what the complexes are for general use it is probably best to ignore s str and treat determinations with the other name addenda as uncertain determinations identified bythe person or persons who last determined the specimen due to the practice at some australian herbaria of changing the name on specimens as part of the curatorial process without examining the specimen a lot of this information is meaningless or even misleading identifier rolethe role the determiner has played in the determination e g determined the specimen det or confirmed an earlier determination conf identified datethe identified date term in the advanced search allows you to query for a range of determination dates if you fill in just a start date or an end date your results will include records of specimens determined since or up to that date respectively in order to query for a particular determination date enter the same date in both fields because of problems associated with querying incomplete dates a result for a search that includes a determination date term will only include records with complete determination dates it is common practice to give only a month and year on determination slips so be aware that a large part of the determinations will be missed when querying by determination date determination notesdetermination notes are any notes that are made by the determiner at the time of the determination these may include diagnostic features a reference to the work that was used to identify the specimen or an indication that the specimen is not typical for the taxon due to the structure of some herbarium databases determination notes have often been included in collecting notes specimen type type status the type status of any type specimens in the results note that if you searched by a taxon name a type specimen in the result is not necessarily a type of the name that you searched for geographythe values in many of the following geography fields have been inferred from the latitude and longitude provided with the specimen records in some cases the geography values stored in the herbarium record may differ from the inferred values due to geocoding errors if you suspect that there is an error with a record you can flag an issue on the record detail page countrythe country in which the specimen was collected note that while most australian and new zealand herbaria hold specimens collected outside australia and new zealand only a small proportion of foreign holdings have been databased and made available through the avh states including coastal waters the state territory or province that australian specimens were collected in queries for records from countries other than australia and new zealand cannot be limited to political divisions below the country level local government areathe local government area in which the specimen was collected based on the latitude and longitude provided with the specimen record latitude and longitudethe latitude and longitude of the collecting locality if correctable errors are detected for example the latitude or longitude is in the wrong hemisphere or the latitude and longitude are transposed the values are corrected and the unprocessed latitude and longitude are given in the latitude provided and longitude provided fields in the record detail page and in downloaded results geodetic datumthe geodetic datum is the reference from which the latitude and longitude are measured the most common datums are wgs84 gda94 and agd66 while important for records of more recent collections the inaccuracy of the georeferences in the bulk of the avh records is much greater than the differences between the different datums geodetic datum is very haphazardly delivered with avh data even with georeferences that are accurate enough for the geodetic datum to be meaningful geocode uncertaintythe geocode uncertainty is a measurement or estimate of how far away in metres the point represented by the latitude and longitude may be from the actual location where the specimen was collected most herbaria use ranges in their collections databases for example 0 100 m 100 m 1 km 1 10 km 10 25 km and gt 25 km the values that are delivered to the avh are the maximum values of these ranges georeferencing methodthe method by which the georeference was obtained for example by gps or by using a topographic map in the hispid standard which is used for data delivery to the avh geocode source is a mixed concept and includes both generalisations for the method used and for the person who provided the georeference in the avh the terms that refer to the person who provided the georeference are stored under georeferenced by georeferenced bya general term for the person who provided the georeference collector or compiler altitudethe altitude in metres of the collecting

the herbarium that sent the duplicates not the herbaria that received the duplicates a potential use case of the duplicates sent to query term in the advanced search would be a herbarium trying to find the original records of specimens they have received on exchange from all other australian herbaria or if used in combination with the herbarium field from one particular herbarium herbarium received fromthe herbarium from which the specimen was received in most cases but not all this will be the herbarium where the original specimen is held herbaria are identified by their index herbariorum acronym ex herb catalogue numberthe catalogue number for the original specimen at the herbarium from which a duplicate specimen was received loan numberthe loan number is the reference number or identifier assigned to the loan by the lending institution and is used by the lender and the borrower for administrative purposes searching by loan number enables botanists who have borrowed from a herbarium that delivers loan data to the avh currently only ad and mel to retrieve the records for all specimens in a particular loan borrowing institutionthe index herbariorum acronym of the borrowing institution data quality checksdata issueswhen avh data is uploaded into the biocache a range of quality assurance checks are performed and potential data issues are flagged some data issues such as transposed or negated latitude and longitude will result in the data being modified other issues will simply be flagged the details of any changes made during processing can be viewed by clicking on the original vs processed button on the record detail page users can also flag potential issues with specimen records by using the flag an issue feature on the record detail page data issues detected during processing or flagged by users are available as a facet on the results page and can be used to narrow down your search results the data issues are also available on the record detail page and in the downloads spatial validityan assessment of whether or not the location is spatially valid based on a range of data quality checks and user contributed annotations if the record suffers from one or more of the geospatial data issues listed in table 2 it is considered spatially suspect otherwise it is spatially valid note that a spatially valid record is not necessarily correctly georeferenced and depending on the data issue a spatially suspect record is not necessarily incorrectly georeferenced outliersoutliers are observations that are distant from the rest of the data in a sample in the avh the sample is observations of a taxon the presence of outliers might indicate that specimens the outliers have been incorrectly identified or georeferenced but also that the distribution is skewed or disjunct or that the taxon has been under collected in certain areas checks for outliers in the avh are done using five climate surfaces precipitation seasonality precipitation of the driest quarter radiation seasonality radiation of the warmest quarter and mean moisture index of the quarter with the highest moisture index the tests are conducted only where there are 20 or more unique locations for a taxon for more information on how the tests are done see the notes on the spatial outlier detection method used by the ala the outlier for layer facet indicates if a specimen is an outlier for an environmental layer based on the known environmental range of the taxon to which the specimen has been identified the outlier layer count facet allows you to filter your results for records that are outliers for certain numbers of environmental layers you can also display your results by outlier for layer or outlier layer count on the distribution map if a record is an outlier for one or more layers the record detail page will display graphs for each of the variables for which the record is an outlier with the distribution of the records of the taxon to which it belongs the layers for which a record is an outlier will also be given in the downloads sensitive dataaustralia s virtual herbarium contains data that may be considered sensitive because of conservation or biosecurity issues the ala sensitive data service contains authoritative lists of taxa that are considered sensitive obtained in collaboration with commonwealth state and territory agencies and data providers with information on how data of these taxa should be handled for each state distribution data for these sensitive taxa may be either withheld or generalised the latter means that instead of a detailed locality the local government area will be given and that the latitude and longitude will be rounded to for example a single decimal place currently distribution data is only completely withheld for a single native species the wollemi pine wollemia nobilis there is a sensitive data facet that can be used to check for sensitive data among query results the record detail page and the downloads indicate whether distribution data has been withheld or generalised for each record multimediathe multimedia facet allows you to filter your results for records that have images or other multimedia attached"

don t need to register separately for the avh but can log in using your ala account details searchthere are five main search options for querying avh data the quick search allows you to quickly perform a search using a single search term the advanced search allows you to perform a more structured query using one or more criteria the batch name search and batch catalogue number search allow you to query by multiple taxon names and multiple catalogue numbers respectively the spatial search allows you to query by either a user defined area or by a polygon defined in a shapefile information on how the different search options work is provided below see the data data page for descriptions of the data associated with each of the query terms quick searchthe quick search first attempts to match the search term against a standard list of botanical names and common names if no matches are found a match will be attempted against the taxon names provided with the specimen records if there is still no match a full text search will be performed against the following fields herbarium name data herbarium herbarium code data herbarium code catalogue number data catalogue number collector data collector determiner data determiner and collecting notes data collecting notes advanced searchthe advanced search allows you to perform a structured query using one or more criteria the data fields you can query on are explained in some detail on the data data page taxon namethe taxon name search attempts to match the search term against a standard list of botanical names and common names if no matches are found a match will be attempted against the taxon names provided with the specimen records taxon name provided data taxon names in avh the taxon name search term can be combined with other search terms in the advanced search taxon names can be botanical names of any rank or common names common names are not provided with the avh data and are not a reliable means of querying avh records you can enter up to four taxon names in the advanced search if you want to query on more than four taxon names at the one time use the batch name search you can then use the facets on the results page to add more search terms to your query full text searchunlike the other items in the advanced search tab full text search will try to locate the entered string in a number of fields these include herbarium name data herbarium herbarium code data herbarium code catalogue number data catalogue number collector data collector determiner data determiner and collecting notes data collecting notes the full text search will match the parts of the search string to entire words but you can add a wildcard to the last part of the string to match to the start of words by default the full text search will split the search string into its parts and will match to strings where the matched words are separated from each other by text or are in a different order than the parts of the search string to avoid this behaviour you can enclose the search string in double quotes wildcards in quoted strings will be ignored individual words in a search string will be matched to pluralised forms of the word for example cow will return records with cows in it batch name searchthe batch name search allows you to perform a query against a list of taxon names each taxon name needs to be entered on a separate line in the query box the list of names entered in the batch name search are matched against the unprocessed taxon names provided with the specimen records taxon name provided the taxon name provided for infraspecific taxa may include authors after the species name and may use inconsistent abbreviations for the infraspecific rank subsp ssp etc because of this you will get the most predictable results from a batch name search if you don t include author names or names of infraspecific taxa in your list of taxon names you can then further refine your results using the facets or by downloading the data and removing any unwanted records unlike the single taxon name searches the batch name search only queries on taxon name provided data taxon names in avh and will not include synonyms in the results therefore for complete results all known synonyms need to be included in the batch of names include figure html src media using avh screenshot batch name search jpg alt batch taxon name search batch catalogue number searchthe batch catalogue number search allows you to perform a query against a list of catalogue numbers each catalogue number needs to be entered on a separate line in the query box catalogue numbers must be formatted exactly as they are stored in the avh see the data page data catalogue number for a summary of the catalogue number formats used by different herbaria spatial searchthe spatial search allows you to perform a search by drawing a circle rectangle or irregular polygon on the map or uploading a shapefile please note that a search is performed only on the first polygon encountered in the shapefile you will need a tool like ogr info to find out which polygon is on top there is also a good chance that the area of interest consists of more than one polygon in the shapefile auto complete suggestionsin the quick search and the taxon name input in the advanced search when you start typing a drop down list with suggestions for taxon names will appear these names come from the ala name list and although they are only names of plants fungi and algae do not necessarily correspond with names in the avh the correspondence between names on the ala name list and names in the avh will improve when the national species lists have been completed resultsthere are three main options for viewing the results of a query as a list of

janet cosh herbariumthe janet cosh herbarium woll was established in the university of wollongong s school of biological sciences in 1991 from a bequest made by the late janet cosh an amateur botanist from the southern highlands of new south wales this remarkable woman began her botanical studies in her late 60s and over the next three decades became widely regarded as an expert on the local flora by the time of her death in 1989 she had made two significant and highly professional collections of flora from the sydney illawarra and highlands regions over 1500 of which formed the basis of the current collection at the university of wollongong the vault at the janet cosh herbarium which houses over 11 000 specimens photo courtesy of the university of wollongong as well as her specimen collections and approximately 1500 annotated botanical drawings janet s contributions to local botany and ecology included discovering local populations of rare species including acacia chalkeri zieria murphyi and grevillea rivularis as well as range extensions of other species including telopea mongaensis corresponding with botanists from the national herbarium of new south wales and assisting the national parks and wildlife service with plant identification compiling fire maps for moreton national park contributing to the establishment and management of natural areas including cecil hoskins robertson and stingray swamp reserves in south east new south wales a resourceful recycler janet used a surprising variety of materials for mounting board everything from old christmas cards to stocking inserts all of her specimens have been remounted except those that she attached to reverse sides of watercolours made by her late father dr jack cosh also included in the bequest and retained as part of the historical collection are notebooks containing janet s collecting locations and notes photographs and photographic slides a library of maps books and identification resources and the handmade cardboard specimen boxes obtained from the national herbarium of new south wales which were used to store the original collection a specimen of pomaderris intermedia collected by janet cosh at bundanoon new south wales in 1976 and mounted on the back of a watercolour by her father dr jack cosh photo courtesy of the university of wollongong a watercolour by dr jack cosh on which the pomaderris intermedia specimen is mounted photo courtesy of the university of wollongong the janet cosh herbarium houses over 11 000 specimens of mainly vascular flora with a focus on species present in the sydney illawarra south coast and southern highlands regions of new south wales ancillary collections include bryophytes collected by prof sharon robinson for studies of the effects of global warming on east antarctic moss and lichen communities banksia pollen slides tasmanian and new zealand bryophytes and various marine macroalgae of the sydney and south coast region the herbarium is currently open two days per week and provides plant identification services training and teaching support for undergraduate classes and researchers la trobe university herbariumthe la trobe university herbarium ltb is relatively young having been established in 1967 in the then school of biological sciences later to become the department of botany it was started by geneticist noel thurling who is responsible for many of the early collections trevor whiffin took over the running of the herbarium in 1973 when he began at the university as a lecturer in plant systematics he kept this role until his retirement in 2008 and most of the collection was developed under his watch the herbarium was first registered with index herbariorum as ltb in 1973 the majority of the collection is from southern and eastern australia with an emphasis on eucalyptus angophora acacia correa and rainforest plants including melastomataceae monimiaceae and rutaceae flindersia ltb also houses some collections from papua new guinea the herbarium is actively used by researchers and students in the new department of ecology evolution and environment both for teaching and to house vouchers and other new collections herbarium assistant chloe foster databasing eucalypt specimens at the la trobe university herbarium photo courtesy of la trobe university until recently ltb which contains an

donation of plant specimens from the rev herman montague rucker rupp a former student of trinity college at the university the collection grew throughout the 20th century thanks to donations from state and private herbaria and through the efforts of staff and students in the school of botany the original herbarium cupboards that were built to house rupp s collection are still used today they have moved buildings twice and are now used in conjunction with rolling compactus to house the c 100 000 melu specimens although small in size compared to the state and territory herbaria it is the largest and most botanically diverse university herbarium and makes a valuable contribution to our combined knowledge of the australian flora all major botanical groups are housed in the collection but it is particularly rich in algae and non vascular plants significant collections include an algae collection of approximately 30 000 specimens which was established by the renowned phycologist dr sophie ducker melu volunteers have recently databased some of ducker s collections from madagascar and the mascarene islands 4 500 mosses and liverworts collected by george scott the foremost authority on temperate mosses and liverworts scott is credited with rekindling interest in the study of bryophytes in southern australia and was the teacher of at least three of today s leading australian bryologists melu have recently begun databasing the scott collection which is available in avh alongside records of scott specimens held in other herbaria a collection of leaf inhabiting microfungi specimens slides and illustrations from dr harry swart a mycologist plant pathologist and artist of architectural and humorous drawings swart joined the school of botany in 1966 as a senior lecturer leaf inhabiting fungi are a highly diverse but relatively unexplored group of fungi that are prevalent on many of the iconic australian plant genera such as eucalyptus and banksia more melu specimen records will be added to avh as the collection continues to be databased by a team of volunteers who are mostly undergraduate students and herbarium staff volunteering at the herbarium gives students great insights into botanical diversity as well as an understanding of how natural history collections are managed students get to see a range of different plants which gives them a good idea of morphological variation and spotting characteristics while helping us curate the collection says herbarium curator dr gillian brown although all herbaria are important research collections university herbaria in particular have an important role in teaching the next generation of botanists the herbarium is a valuable teaching resource explains brown specimens are used in practical classes to demonstrate the diagnostic features of different plant groups and some subjects require students to prepare their own specimens which in turn are incorporated into the collection one of the most important teaching and research collections is a collection of approximately 7 000 eucalyptus specimens collected by staff including professors david ashton and pauline ladiges and students over the years the most significant of these is the monocalypt collection eucalyptus subgenus eucalyptus which comprises about 2 600 specimens from western and eastern australia this collection encompasses all species of the subgenus and includes voucher specimens sampled for dna sequencing seedlings cultivated from the specimens which display characters useful for identification and collections preserved in alcohol for microscopy multiple samples from different populations exist for many species illustrating their geographic and morphological variation there are 16 herbaria in australian universities which together house over 420 000 specimens melu is only the second university herbarium to join avh the n c w beadle herbarium ne at the university of new england joined avh in 2013 and has over 80 000 records in avh several other university herbaria are working towards delivering data to avh and we hope to have the la trobe university herbarium ltb and james cook university herbarium jct on board in the coming months curator dr gillian brown s favourite specimen tetratheca ciliata melu d015072a rhodocallis elegans melu a110065a a red algal specimen collected in warrnambool victoria by prof gerry kraft in 1995 herbarium volunteer megan rixon curating the fungal collection at melu megan has databased over 200 specimens of fungi isotype of eucalyptus verrucata collected from mount abrupt grampians victoria october 1979 by then student julie marginson a eucalyptus globulus specimen melu d103755a collected by ian clarke in 1977 on the university campus this is one of thousands of high resolution images of eucalypt specimens at melu"
