The Australasian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) is an online resource that provides
dynamic access to the wealth of plant specimen data held by Australian and New
Zealand herbaria. The AVH is a collaborative project developed under the
auspices of the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH).

Australian and New Zealand herbaria house over eight million specimens of
plants, algae and fungi. These specimens provide a permanent record of the
occurrence of a species at a particular place and time, and are the primary
resource for research on the classification and distribution of the Australasian
flora.

Herbarium specimens are accompanied by information on where and when they were
collected, by whom, their current identification, and information on habitat and
associated species. To date, almost 80 per cent of the specimens housed in
Australian and New Zealand herbaria have been databased. This data forms a
valuable resource for a wide range of stakeholders, including:

- conservation agencies
- universities and schools
- the scientific community
- biodiversity networks and conservation groups
- natural resource, agriculture and forestry agencies
- environmental consultants
- Australasian and international herbaria and botanic gardens.

The combined specimen data from each herbarium’s collection provides the most
complete picture of the distribution of Australia’s and New Zealand’s flora to
date. Data obtained via the AVH can be used for many different purposes,
including:

- mapping plant, algae and fungi distributions
- planning revegetation work
- tracking the distribution of invasive species
- bioprospecting
- conservation planning
- prioritising resources for plant collecting and biodiversity surveys
- historical research.

The AVH is a dynamic resource. New specimen records are added as herbaria
continue to database their ever-growing collections, and existing records are
updated to reflect name changes and data validation work.
