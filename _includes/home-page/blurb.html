  <p>Australian and New Zealand herbaria house over eight million plant, algae and fungi 
      specimens. Herbarium specimens are an important resource 
      for research on the Australasian flora and provide a permanent record of the occurrence 
      of a species at a particular place and time. 
      The AVH provides access to the collecting data associated with these specimens.
