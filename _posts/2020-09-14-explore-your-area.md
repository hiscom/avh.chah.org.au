The 'Explore your area' functionality has been available in the ALA for years, 
but I for one never knew it was available in the AVH as well.

'Explore your area' is available in the AVH at 
[https://avh.ala.org.au/explore/your-area](https://avh.ala.org.au/explore/your-area). 
When you first enter the page, you will be asked if the page is allowed to use your 
location, as by default the location where you are is used, but you can also 
type in a street address, postcode or latitude and longitude.

The screenshot below is for the postcode the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria is 
in, 3004.

    alt="Explore your area: 3004"
    caption="Explore your area for postcode 3004."
    href="https://avh.ala.org.au/explore/your-area#-37.8302|144.9805|12|ALL_SPECIES"
%}

In the pane on the left, with the species and the groups, you can narrow down 
your results to a particular group, for example plants or fungi, or, even better,
bryophytes.

    alt="Explore your area: 3004, bryophytes"
    caption="Explore your area for postcode 3004, narrowed down to show just bryophyte occurrences."
    href="https://avh.ala.org.au/explore/your-area#-37.8302|144.9805|12|Bryophytes"
%}

You can narrow down your research even further to a particular species. When you 
click on one of the species names, the box will expand a bit and show links to 
the species profile and list of records.

    caption="When clicking on a species name, links to the species profile and list of records will appear."

Clicking on the 'list of records' link will take you to the search result page in AVH, 
just as if you have done any other search. The 'View selected records' button 
just above the pane will take you to the search result of any selection you made, 
so you can make use of the facets available there and explore further. Before you 
have selected any taxa, this same button will be called 'View all records' and 
get you to all AVH records for the area. The 'Download' button will take you 
directly to the download page for your search result.

    search where you can explore further."

%}

In the map pane, you can do most of the things you can do in the map for the 
occurrence search. Additionally, you can drag the icon in the centre of the 
search area to another position on the map to shift the search area. You can 
also set the radius of the search area to 1, 5 (default) or 10 kilometer in the 
box at the left above the left pane.

Just like in the occurrence search map, you can click on a dot and an info 
window will appear with basic information about the record. Clicking on 'View 
record' will take you to the occurrence page. Remember, if you hold down the 
CTRL key on your keyboard when you click on the link, the page will open in a 
new tab, which will make it easier to get back to your Explore your area result.
