The Atlas of Living Australia has recently posted a blog entry describing the data processing in the Atlas. As AVH is part of the Atlas and AVH data undergoes the same data processing as other ALA data, this blog is of interest to AVH users as well. You can find the blog entry at [http://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data/data-processing](https://www.ala.org.au/blogs-news/data/data-processing/).
